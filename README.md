# Collab Critique
A web application for academic whistleblowing, complete with the ability to for admins to send emails to professors, view public reports, and comment on reports.

I obtained key information to define project specifications and requirements through elicitation methods with students and professors. Created precise user stories and design that led developement efforts.

Technologies:
* Used Django to leverage Python's dynamic capabilities and it's solid foundation for web application developement
* Integration with Google Authentication to use Google accounts to ensure unique users and prevent spam
* Deployed on Heroku and integrated with Amazon S3 for secure storage of reports
* Utilized PostgreSQL for data storage due to its reliability and compatibility with Django and Heroku
